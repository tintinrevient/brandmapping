# Brand Mapping

Q-Gram String Comparison Algorithm
It is basically a Java web application based on Spring Boot.
There come into the following four types of the string comparison algorithms to compute the mapping rate of arbitrary two strings:
1. Keyword Priority
2. LCS (Longest Common String)
3. Levenshtein
4. Q-Gram

Next step:
1. Integrate with a database containing all the brand information;
2. Illustrate the four algorithms in this README.md.
